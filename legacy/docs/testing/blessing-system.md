# Blessing System (Future Concept)

## Overview
The Blessing System was an early concept for marking components as "blessed" (passed) after validation. This concept has been integrated into our current testing framework as "passing" status.

## Current Implementation
- Components are marked as "passed" after successful testing
- Validation occurs through our automated testing framework
- Results are tracked in test logs and reports

## Future Considerations
- Potential for more granular status tracking
- Integration with quality metrics
- Automated blessing workflows
- Performance benchmarks
