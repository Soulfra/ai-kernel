# QualityOrchestrator

## Overview
The QualityOrchestrator is a system health monitoring and optimization component that continuously tracks system metrics, detects issues, and provides suggestions for improvements. It helps maintain system stability and performance by monitoring various aspects of the system and alerting when thresholds are exceeded.

## Core Features
- **System Metrics Collection**: Gathers comprehensive system metrics including memory usage, CPU utilization, response times, and error rates
- **Threshold Monitoring**: Configurable thresholds for various system metrics with automatic violation detection
- **Issue Detection**: Identifies system issues based on metric thresholds and historical trends
- **Optimization Suggestions**: Generates actionable suggestions for resolving detected issues
- **Quality Reporting**: Produces detailed reports on system health and performance
- **Metrics Retention**: Manages historical metrics with configurable retention periods
- **Event Emission**: Emits events for significant system issues and state changes

## Configuration
```javascript
{
  metricsDir: './logs/metrics',           // Directory for storing metrics
  thresholdConfig: {
    errorRate: 0.05,                      // 5% error rate threshold
    responseTime: 1000,                   // 1 second response time threshold
    memoryUsage: 0.8,                     // 80% memory usage threshold
    cpuUsage: 0.7,                        // 70% CPU usage threshold
    diskSpace: 0.9                        // 90% disk space threshold
  },
  checkInterval: 60000,                   // 1 minute check interval
  retentionPeriod: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 // 7 days retention
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Initialization
```javascript
const QualityOrchestrator = require('./quality-orchestrator');

const orchestrator = new QualityOrchestrator({
  metricsDir: './logs/metrics',
  checkInterval: 60000
});

await orchestrator.initialize();
```

### Event Handling
```javascript
orchestrator.on('issues_detected', ({ timestamp, issues, suggestions }) => {
  console.log(`Issues detected at ${timestamp}:`);
  issues.forEach(issue => {
    console.log(`- ${issue.type}: ${issue.message}`);
  });
  console.log('Suggested actions:');
  suggestions.forEach(suggestion => {
    console.log(`- ${suggestion.action} (${suggestion.priority} priority)`);
  });
});

orchestrator.on('error', ({ type, error }) => {
  console.error(`Error in ${type}: ${error}`);
});
```

### Generating Quality Reports
```javascript
const report = await orchestrator.generateQualityReport();
console.log('System Health Report:');
console.log(`Critical Issues: ${report.summary.criticalIssues}`);
console.log(`Total Issues: ${report.summary.totalIssues}`);
console.log(`Pending Suggestions: ${report.summary.pendingSuggestions}`);
```

## Metrics Format
```javascript
{
  timestamp: "2024-03-21T12:00:00.000Z",
  system: {
    memory: {
      heapUsed: 1000000,
      heapTotal: 2000000,
      external: 500000,
      arrayBuffers: 100000
    },
    cpu: {
      user: 1000,
      system: 500
    },
    uptime: 3600
  },
  performance: {
    responseTimes: [100, 150, 200],
    errorRates: [0.01, 0.02, 0.03],
    throughput: 1000
  },
  resources: {
    diskSpace: {
      total: 1000000000,
      used: 500000000,
      free: 500000000
    },
    activeConnections: 50
  }
}
```

## Error Handling
The QualityOrchestrator implements robust error handling for various scenarios:
- **Initialization Errors**: Handles directory creation and permission issues
- **Metrics Collection Errors**: Gracefully handles failures in metric collection
- **Analysis Errors**: Continues operation even if analysis of some metrics fails
- **Storage Errors**: Manages file system errors during metrics storage
- **Cleanup Errors**: Handles errors during metrics cleanup and retention

## Testing Strategy
The QualityOrchestrator includes comprehensive test coverage:
- **Unit Tests**: Tests for individual methods and functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Tests for interaction with the file system and event system
- **Error Case Tests**: Tests for various error scenarios and recovery
- **Performance Tests**: Tests for metrics collection and analysis performance
- **Cleanup Tests**: Tests for proper resource cleanup and retention

## Integration
The QualityOrchestrator integrates with other system components:
- **LogOrchestrator**: Logs system issues and quality reports
- **DebugOrchestrator**: Provides metrics for debugging system issues
- **TaskOrchestrator**: Monitors task execution performance
- **DocumentationOrchestrator**: Generates quality reports for documentation

## Maintenance
Regular maintenance tasks for the QualityOrchestrator include:
- **Metrics Cleanup**: Regular cleanup of old metrics files
- **Threshold Review**: Periodic review and adjustment of thresholds
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitoring the orchestrator's own performance
- **Report Analysis**: Regular analysis of quality reports for trends
