## Overview

This section provides a high-level overview of the component.


## Implementation

This section details the implementation specifics.


## Maintenance

This section covers maintenance and troubleshooting information.

## Deduplication Utility: task-deduplicator.js

The `task-deduplicator.js` module provides a modular, <250-line, plug-and-play deduplication utility for tasks and plans. It is designed for dynamic, router-friendly use and can be imported by any orchestrator or router.

### Purpose
- Prevents duplicate tasks/plans by hashing key fields
- Enables merging/updating of existing tasks instead of creating duplicates
- Improves triage, maintainability, and auditability

### Usage
```js
const { isDuplicateTask, mergeTask } = require('scripts/core/task-deduplicator');
if (!isDuplicateTask(newTask, existingTasks)) addTask(newTask);
else {
  const existing = findDuplicateTask(newTask, existingTasks);
  const merged = mergeTask(newTask, existing);
  // Update the existing task with merged fields
}
```

### Integration Pattern
- Import into orchestrators/routers
- Use before adding any new task
- No side effects or file operations
- <250 lines, easy to test and maintain

### Benefits
- Ensures a single source of truth for each task/plan
- Reduces noise and confusion in task logs
- Makes it easier to triage issues and maintain the system

## Universal Auto-Logging Standard

All orchestrators, scripts, and agents must emit structured log events for every significant action, state change, or error, using the canonical LogOrchestrator. This ensures:
- Complete traceability and auditability
- Rich project context and awareness
- Automated debugging, triage, and feedback
- Support for future analytics, RAG, and self-healing

**Example:**
```js
const LogOrchestrator = require('scripts/core/log-orchestrator');
const logger = new LogOrchestrator({ logDir: './logs/debug' });
logger.info('Task deduplicated', { orchestrator: 'TaskManager', taskId, details });
```

See [LOG_ORCHESTRATOR.md](../orchestration/LOG_ORCHESTRATOR.md) for full API and usage patterns.

## Backup and Safety

- All documentation system operations (migration, consolidation, deletion, etc.) must be preceded by a verified backup.
- The canonical `BackupOrchestrator` enforces this requirement.
- See [backup-standards.md](./backup-standards.md) for details.

## Orchestrator Routing & Logging Standards

All orchestrators must:
- Be routed through the meta-orchestrator for initialization, event handling, and workflow management
- Use the canonical logging and telemetry system (LogOrchestrator, TaskLogger, TelemetryManager)
- Prohibit ad-hoc logging (e.g., console.log) except in explicitly allowed test or demo files
- Surface all errors, stubs, and TODOs to the suggestion log, dashboards, and magic list

This standard ensures full auditability, traceability, and compliance across all automation and orchestration flows.

## Reflective Mesh Kernel & PWA Operator Layer Standards

The Reflective Mesh Kernel is a core standard for the next phase of CLARITY_ENGINE. All nodes must:
- Implement a meta-orchestrator capable of self-reflection, suggestion surfacing, and LLM/operator input
- Support mesh networking for node discovery, state sync, and distributed operations
- Provide a PWA dashboard for live system map, health, and actionable suggestions
- Expose all actions and state via CLI, API, and PWA
- Ensure all documentation, compliance, and onboarding flows are updated and cross-linked

## Onboarding & Handoff Standards

All new features, orchestrators, and contributors must:
- Comply with mesh, PWA, and self-reflection standards as defined in the Reflective Mesh Kernel & PWA Operator Layer section
- Reference and follow the checklist in [Finalization Plan Section 11](../../../project_meta/plans/FINALIZATION_PLAN.md#11-reflective-mesh-kernel--pwa-operator-layer)
- Ensure all onboarding and handoff docs are updated and cross-linked to new standards

## Overseer/Batch Processor Orchestrator Standard

The Overseer/Batch Processor orchestrator is responsible for:
- Polling all suggestion logs, task logs, dashboards, and orchestrator states
- Maintaining a queue of in-progress, blocked, and ready-to-integrate tasks
- Dispatching sub-tasks to orchestrators (mesh, PWA, backup, docs, tests, etc.)
- Validating E2E completion and blocking/approving integration
- Surfacing system-level status, blocks, and next actions for operators/LLMs/PWA

This orchestrator ensures that no spiral-out or integration task is marked complete until all standards, docs, and tests are satisfied and the system is fully validated.
