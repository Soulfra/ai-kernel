# Kernel Backup+Buildup E2E Checklist

## Purpose
This checklist ensures the backup+buildup kernel is robust, self-healing, and fully E2E tested before expanding to the rest of the system.

## Checklist
- [ ] All files and directories are created as needed (self-healing pattern)
- [ ] No ENOENT ("no such file or directory") errors in any flow
- [ ] All logs, manifests, and meta files are present after backup and restore
- [ ] E2E backup+buildup test passes green (see `/tests/core/backup-buildup.e2e.test.js`)
- [ ] Self-healing pattern (`ensureFileAndDir`) is used everywhere files are written
- [ ] Pattern and process are documented in `/docs/standards/`
- [ ] Checklist is referenced in onboarding and handoff docs

## Continuous Improvement
- Any surfaced gap becomes the next actionable item
- Update this checklist and docs as the system evolves
