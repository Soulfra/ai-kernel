# Logging & Traceability Plan

## Purpose
This document defines the standards and requirements for logging, traceability, and feedback automation in the Clarity Engine system. It is updated as standards evolve and will be archived when finalized.

## Logging Requirements
- All actions (validation, testing, archiving, restoration) must be logged via LogOrchestrator
- Logs must be JSON, context-rich, and non-recursive
- All logs must include timestamp, action, file/component, reason/context, and result
- Archive actions must be logged in both debug and task logs

## Log Structure
- Use structured JSON for all logs
- Include fields: timestamp, action, component, file, reason, result, relatedTaskId, user (if applicable)
- Rotate and archive logs regularly

## Feedback Loop Automation
- Parse logs and test results to suggest next actions
- Summarize errors and unresolved issues for review
- Reference logs in documentation and action plans
