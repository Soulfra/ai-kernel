# Standards

## Overview
Core system documentation and architecture

> **See also:** [Hashing, Telemetry, and Audit Trail Requirements](#hashing-telemetry-and-audit-trail-canonical-requirements) for compliance and auditability standards required for all orchestrators and batch jobs.

## Hashing, Telemetry, and Audit Trail (Canonical Requirements)

All orchestrators, batch jobs, and backup flows in CLARITY_ENGINE must:
- Generate and log hashes for all critical outputs (e.g., backup manifests, reports)
- Inject telemetry spans for all major operations (start, end, error, recovery)
- Log all actions, errors, and recoveries to the suggestion log/blamechain
- Validate hashes and telemetry in E2E/integration tests
