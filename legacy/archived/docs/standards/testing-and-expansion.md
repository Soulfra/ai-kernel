# E2E & Modular Testing + Documentation-First Approach

## Overview

This standard defines the approach for robust, scalable, and auditable development in CLARITY_ENGINE:
- All major features, modules, and orchestrators must have E2E and modular tests.
- Documentation is always kept up to date with the code and tests.
- Every lesson learned, surfaced gap, and fix is documented and spiral-out ready.

## Why E2E/Modular Testing?
- Catches integration and regression issues before they reach production.
- Ensures every module is self-contained, reproducible, and safe to integrate.
- Enables rapid onboarding and scaling by providing living, actionable examples.
- Makes the system auditable and compliant by design.

## Process
1. **Write or update documentation for every new feature/module.**
2. **Add/expand E2E and modular tests (see `/tests/core/`).**
3. **Run the master test runner (`tests/all.e2e.test.js`) locally and in CI.**
4. **Document all surfaced issues, lessons learned, and fixes.**
5. **Update onboarding and standards docs as the system evolves.**

## Key Tools
- **Master Test Runner:** `tests/all.e2e.test.js` (runs all major E2E/integration/expansion tests)
- **Expansion Harness:** `tests/core/expansion-harness.e2e.test.js` (modular/epoch-based integration)
- **Backup+Buildup E2E:** `tests/core/backup-buildup.e2e.test.js` (minimal proof, spiral-out ready)

## Lessons Learned
- E2E and modular tests are the best way to surface integration issues early.
- Documentation must be updated with every major change—out-of-date docs are a liability.
- The combination of living tests and living docs is the foundation for scaling, onboarding, and compliance.

## Continuous Improvement
- Any surfaced gap becomes the next actionable item.
- The process, tests, and docs are always evolving—spiral-out is the default.
- Reference this doc in onboarding, handoff, and compliance materials.
