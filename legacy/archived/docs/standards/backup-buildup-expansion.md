# Modular Backup+Buildup Expansion & Epoch Integration

## Overview

This standard defines the process for robust, modular, and auditable expansion of the CLARITY_ENGINE system using backup+buildup (restore) flows and epoch-based integration. It ensures every module, orchestrator, or agent can be safely added, tested, and integrated without breaking the system.

## Why Modular Backup+Buildup?
- Guarantees every module is self-contained, reproducible, and compliant.
- Surfaces integration issues early, before they reach production.
- Enables safe, scalable, and auditable system growth.
- Provides a living audit trail and onboarding path for new contributors.

## Process: Epoch-Based Expansion

1. **Module Isolation:**
   - Each module (or orchestrator/agent/plugin) must pass backup+buildup E2E in isolation (in a temp workspace).
2. **Incremental Integration (Epochs):**
   - Add the module to the current base (all previously integrated modules).
   - Run backup+buildup and E2E tests on the new base.
   - Log and cluster any surfaced breakages or incompatibilities.
3. **Full System Validation:**
   - After all modules are added, run backup+buildup and E2E on the full system.
   - Document all surfaced issues and fixes.

## Automation & Harness
- Use a test harness to automate:
  - Isolated backup+buildup for each module.
  - Incremental (epoch) integration and testing.
  - Logging and clustering of all surfaced issues.
- The harness should:
  - Accept a list of modules/files.
  - Run each module in isolation, then in combination with the current base.
  - Output a living log of all results, gaps, and lessons learned.

## Audit Trail & Documentation
- Every epoch and integration step must be logged (success, failure, fixes).
- Keep a living ledger of module integration, surfaced gaps, and lessons learned.
- Reference this doc in onboarding, compliance, and handoff materials.

## CI/CD Integration
- Wire modular and epoch-based tests into CI.
- Block merges/releases if any module or integration epoch fails backup+buildup or E2E.
- Surface all issues in dashboards and suggestion logs.

## Spiral-Out & Continuous Improvement
- Any surfaced gap becomes the next actionable item.
- Update this doc and the harness with every major change or lesson learned.
- Use the process for onboarding, scaling, and handoff.
