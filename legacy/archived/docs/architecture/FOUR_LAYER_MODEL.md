# Four-Layer Architecture

This system is designed for maximum resilience, transparency, and user/community control. It is organized into four layers:

## 1. Immutable Core
- **Responsibilities:** Minimal, locked-down, and versioned logic (kernel, contracts, security primitives).
- **Extension Points:** Only via explicit, versioned upgrades.
- **Error Handling:** Fails fast, logs to orchestration layer.

## 2. Work/Execution Layer
- **Responsibilities:** All actual work (plugins, LLMs, agents, batch runners, workflow modules).
- **Extension Points:** Add/replace plugins, agents, integrations.
- **Error Handling:** Catches and logs errors, batches suggestions for orchestration.

## 3. Orchestration/Coordination
- **Responsibilities:** Routes tasks, logs, suggestions, and results between layers. Handles error batching, retries, and snowballing improvements.
- **Extension Points:** Add new orchestrators, routers, batch runners.
- **Error Handling:** Surfaces all errors/suggestions to user/community layer.

## 4. User/Community ("We the People")
- **Responsibilities:** Final authority for review, approval, or override. Feedback, voting, and governance.
- **Extension Points:** Dashboard, logs, feedback forms, governance plugins.
- **Error Handling:** All logs, suggestions, and errors are surfaced for review.

## Example Directory Structure
```
/core/           # Immutable core logic
/plugins/        # Work/execution modules (LLMs, agents, integrations)
/scripts/core/   # Orchestration, routers, batch runners
/logs/           # Logs, suggestions, task logs
/dashboard/      # User/community interface
```

## Error/Feedback Flow
- Errors and suggestions are always logged and surfaced up through the layers, never blocked or hidden.
- The user/community layer is the final authority for review and governance.
