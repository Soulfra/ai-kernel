# Soulfra Layer0 Architecture & Cryptographic Standard

## 1. Rationale & Vision

Soulfra Layer0 is the universal automation, orchestration, and control layer for the modern web. It bridges Web2.0 (SaaS, APIs, automation) with Web3 (immutability, decentralization, trustless execution), enabling:
- **End-to-end auditability and trust**
- **Composable, modular automation**
- **Seamless SaaS, BYOK, and decentralized models**
- **Unified cryptographic signatures for all actions and data**

## 2. Architecture Overview

```
[User/Operator]
     |
     v
[Layer0: Soulfra Orchestrator, Automation, API, Dashboard]
     |
     v
[Web3 Backend: Immutable Ledger, Decentralized Storage, Smart Contracts]
```

- **Layer0 (Web2.5):** Handles all automation, routing, LLM/API calls, payments, and user interaction. All actions are logged, signed, and auditable.
- **Web3 Backend:** Stores hashes, signatures, and critical data on-chain or in decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS, Arweave, EVM chains).

## 3. Unified Cryptographic Signature (SoulfraHash)

Every action, transaction, or data object is signed with a composite hash:
- **SHA256**
- **SHA512**
- **SHA3512** (if available)
- **Blake3B**

The resulting signature (SoulfraHash) is stored in every JSON log, audit trail, and (optionally) on-chain.

### Example JSON Log Entry
```json
{
  "action": "llm_inference",
  "input": "...",
  "output": "...",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-27T06:00:00Z",
  "soulfraHash": {
    "sha256": "...",
    "sha512": "...",
    "sha3512": "...",
    "blake3b": "..."
  }
}
```

## 4. Cryptographic Flow
1. **Action occurs in Layer0 (automation, LLM call, payment, etc.)**
2. **All relevant data is serialized to JSON.**
3. **SoulfraHash is computed (SHA256, SHA512, SHA3512, Blake3B).**
4. **Hash/signature is embedded in the JSON log.**
5. **(Optional) Hash is anchored to Web3 backend (on-chain, IPFS, etc.) for immutability.**
6. **All logs are auditable, tamper-evident, and composable.**

## 5. End-to-End Trust & Composability
- **Every action is signed and auditable.**
- **Logs can be verified independently or on-chain.**
- **Supports SaaS, BYOK, and full decentralization.**
- **Users can export, verify, or anchor their own data.**

## 6. SaaS, BYOK, and Decentralized Models
- **SaaS:** Users interact with Layer0, pay via Stripe/crypto, and get seamless automation.
- **BYOK:** Power users can bring their own keys, models, or storage.
- **Decentralized:** All logs and actions can be anchored to Web3 for full trustlessness.

## 7. Implementation Notes
- Use Node.js crypto libraries for hash computation.
- Store all logs as JSON with embedded SoulfraHash.
- Provide CLI/API for exporting, verifying, and anchoring logs.
- Modularize for easy extension to new hash algorithms or backends.

## 8. Backrunning & Continuous Validation

Soulfra Layer0 supports backrunning: the ability to retroactively validate, hash, and anchor all past logs and actions. This ensures that even legacy data can be brought up to the latest standard for auditability and trust.

- A backrunner script scans all historical logs, computes SoulfraHash for each, and (optionally) anchors them to the Web3 backend.
- Any missing or invalid hashes are surfaced as actionable TODOs in the dashboard and suggestion log.
- This process can be run on demand or scheduled for continuous compliance.

## 9. Continuous Improvement & Spiral-Out

The Soulfra Standard is a living system. As new cryptographic methods, backends, or compliance requirements emerge, the standard and all automation/scripts are updated. The spiral-out process ensures:
- All surfaced gaps, lessons, and improvements are logged in the suggestion log and dashboard.
- Contributors are guided to update docs, scripts, and backrunning tools as the standard evolves.
- The system is always ready for onboarding, handoff, and scaling.

## 10. Testing & End-to-End Validation

To ensure the system is always compliant and robust:
- Run the full orchestrator/test/validation suite regularly.
- Use the backrunner to validate and hash all logs.
- Surface any gaps or failures in the [Finalization Dashboard](../../project_meta/insights/finalization_dashboard.md) and [suggestion log](../../project_meta/suggestion_log.md).
- Reference the [SOULFRA_STANDARD_HANDOFF.md](../../docs/hand-off/SOULFRA_STANDARD_HANDOFF.md) for onboarding and troubleshooting.

## 11. Soulfra Snowball: E2E Automation & Backup

The Soulfra Snowball script is the master automation entrypoint for E2E validation, backup, and spiral-out. It:
- Runs the backrunner to validate and hash all logs
- Updates the dashboard with all surfaced issues
- Runs the backup orchestrator to create a full system backup
- (Optionally) runs tests and E2E orchestrators
- Surfaces all issues and TODOs for spiral-out improvement

### Usage

Run:
```sh
npm run snowball
```
This will:
- Ensure all logs are up to standard
- Update the dashboard and suggestion log
- Create a full backup (see [Backup Orchestrator](../../../scripts/core/backup-orchestrator.js))
- Surface any issues for immediate action

This process ensures you always have a clean, auditable, and continuously improving system ready for onboarding, handoff, or release.

For latest status, see the [Finalization Dashboard](../../project_meta/insights/finalization_dashboard.md).

## 12. Soulfra Snowball: Automation Flow & Standards

This section documents the full automation flow for the Soulfra Snowball process, ensuring all steps are traceable, auditable, and up to Soulfra standards.

### Automation Flow
1. **Dry Run:**
   - Run the snowball script in dry run mode to preview all actions and surface missing steps or errors.
   - Review logs and suggestion log for surfaced issues.
2. **Debug & Fix:**
   - Address any errors or gaps surfaced in the dry run.
   - Rerun dry run until all steps are clean.
3. **Live Run:**
   - Run the snowball script live to update logs, dashboard, and create a backup.
   - Review outputs and logs for any new issues.
4. **Backup Validation:**
   - Confirm the backup file exists and is restorable.
   - Log backup results in the dashboard and suggestion log.
5. **Spiral-Out:**
   - Surface and address any new issues or TODOs.
   - Repeat the process as needed for continuous improvement.
6. **Stopping Point:**
   - Once all steps are clean and backup is working, document the state and prepare for next phase (e.g., Codex integration).

### Process Map
```
[Dry Run] -> [Debug & Fix] -> [Live Run] -> [Backup Validation] -> [Spiral-Out] -> [Stopping Point]
```

### Standards
- All steps must log start, success, and failure with timestamps.
- All errors and warnings are surfaced in the run log, suggestion log, and dashboard.
- Triage summary is included after every run.
- Backups must be validated and logged.
- The process is repeatable, auditable, and spiral-out ready.

### Usage
- Dry run: `npm run snowball -- --dry-run`
- Live run: `npm run snowball`

See [soulfra-snowball.js](../../../scripts/core/soulfra-snowball.js) and [backup-orchestrator.js](../../../scripts/core/backup-orchestrator.js) for implementation details.

## 13. Soulfra Testing & Validation Standard

To ensure the highest level of reliability, auditability, and continuous improvement, the following testing and validation standards are required for all Soulfra systems:

### Requirements
- **Unit Tests:** Every core function, orchestrator, and utility must have unit tests, including tests for both success and failure cases.
- **Integration & E2E Tests:** All orchestrators, backup flows, and automation scripts must be tested end-to-end, including edge cases and error paths.
- **Negative/Failure-Path Tests:** Tests must intentionally break things (e.g., missing files, bad input, permission errors) to ensure errors are surfaced and never masked.
- **Full Traceability:** Every test, run, and error must be logged with full context (stack trace, environment, command, timestamp).
- **No Error Suppression:** All errors and warnings must be surfaced in the console, run log, suggestion log, and dashboard. No error is ever suppressed or ignored.
- **Preflight Health Checks:** Before running any automation, scripts must check for required files, scripts, dependencies, and environment variables. Fail fast and surface any missing prerequisites.
- **CI Enforcement:** All tests (unit, integration, E2E, negative) must run in CI before any merge or deploy. CI must block on any failure and surface all errors in logs and dashboards.
- **Spiral-Out:** Every surfaced gap, regression, or lesson learned is logged and becomes the next actionable item. Docs, tests, and automation are updated as the standard evolves.
