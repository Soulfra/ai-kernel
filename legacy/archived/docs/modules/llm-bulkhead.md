# LLM Bulkhead

## Overview
Provides a safe, stateless interface for LLM-powered concept extraction, summarization, and tagging.

## Input
- Batched concepts or documents

## Output
- Enhanced concepts/tags (to `/concepts/` or `/clusters/`)
- Logs to `/logs/`

## Anti-Recursion
- Stateless, never triggers further LLM calls
- Only processes explicit batches
