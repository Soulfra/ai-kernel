# Soulfra Standard Handoff Guide

## 1. Overview
The Soulfra Standard ensures all code, docs, and automations are orchestrator-driven, self-healing, and compliance-first. All compliance, dependency, and standardization actions are routed through canonical orchestrators. **All LLM calls must be routed through `scripts/core/llm-router.js` via orchestrators, with context-aware routing and deep logging for compliance and auditability.**

## 2. The Triangle Architecture
- **Core Kernel:** Minimal, non-recursive, immutable logic. Handles only essential orchestration, logging, and error routing.
- **Orchestrator/Middleware Layer:** All automation, validation, compliance, and error triage. Batch, parallel, and fallback logic lives here. No direct business logic or UX. **LLMRouter is called here for all LLM interactions.**
- **Outer Automation/UX Layer:** Handles user interaction, batch processing, onboarding, and advanced automations. All actions routed through the orchestrator.

## 3. Key Components
- OrchestrationRouter: `scripts/core/orchestration-router.js`
- DependencyOrchestrator: `scripts/core/dependency-orchestrator.js`
- SoulfraStandardizer: `scripts/core/soulfra-standardizer.js`
- MCP Dashboard: `scripts/mcp-dashboard.js`
- LogOrchestrator, DebugOrchestrator: Logging and error handling
- **LLMRouter: `scripts/core/llm-router.js` (context-aware LLM routing and logging)**

## 4. Directory Structure & Conventions
- All scripts and automations live in `scripts/` and `scripts/core/`
- Docs and templates in `docs/` and `docs/templates/`
- All logging and compliance routed through orchestrators
- **All LLM calls routed through LLMRouter and orchestrators**
- No ad-hoc scripts or direct file writes

## 5. Usage & Workflow
- Run the dashboard: `node scripts/mcp-dashboard.js`
- Run dependency audit: `node scripts/mcp-dashboard.js --audit-deps`
- Run standardization: `node scripts/mcp-dashboard.js --standardize`
- All actions and errors are logged and surfaced in the dashboard
- **All LLM interactions are routed, logged, and auditable via LLMRouter and orchestrators**

## 6. Extending the System
- Add new compliance rules to the standardizer
- Route all new scripts and automations through the orchestrator
- **Integrate new LLMs or models via LLMRouter**
- Update the dashboard for new features

## 7. Monetization
- Free vs. Pro features are enforced in the orchestrator and dashboard
- See `README.md` for details

## 8. Onboarding & Support
- All actions are logged and auditable
- For help, see the dashboard or contact the project lead

## 9. CLI Script Standards
- All CLI/batch scripts must explicitly call process.exit(0) (or process.exit(1) on failure) at the end of execution.
- This ensures clean exit, CI/CD reliability, and no zombie processes.
- Scripts that track failures should use a nonzero exit code for failures.

## Automated Batch Backup, Meta-Summarization, and Self-Audit

- Every backup now includes all living docs, logs, TODOs, meta-summaries, and a compliance self-audit.
- This ensures that handoff, onboarding, and recovery are always up to date and fully auditable.
- See FINALIZATION_PLAN.md for the canonical system map and backup flow.

## Self-Diagnosing, Self-Healing LLM Integration

- All LLM orchestrators and routers auto-detect missing packages, API keys, or stub/fake responses.
- Any gap is logged with a clear remediation step in `project_meta/suggestion_log.md` and surfaced in the dashboard/onboarding.
- The system will never silently fallback or return a fake response—every issue is actionable and auditable.
- See the suggestion log and dashboard for any required fixes or onboarding steps.

## LLM Auto-Remediation CLI

- Use `node scripts/fix-missing-llm.js` to auto-detect and fix missing LLM packages and API keys.
- The script will prompt for missing packages and keys, and log all actions to the suggestion log.
- Run this script as part of onboarding or troubleshooting any LLM integration issue.

## Lessons Learned & Continuous Improvement

- The system auto-summarizes all surfaced gaps, root causes, and successful remediations into `project_meta/insights/lessons_learned.md`.
- Onboarding and troubleshooting docs are auto-updated with the latest lessons learned and actionable recommendations.
- This ensures onboarding and handoff are always improving and up to date with real-world experience.

## First Run Onboarding & E2E Recovery

- Use `node scripts/first-run-onboarding.js` for a full end-to-end setup, health check, meta-summarization, dashboard review, backup, and recovery simulation.
- This script is the recommended starting point for onboarding and handoff.
- All actions and results are logged to the suggestion log and surfaced in the dashboard.

## The Soulfra Snowball Process: Self-Updating, Self-Improving Automation

The Soulfra Standard is designed to compound improvements and surface every gap automatically. Here's how the snowball process works:

1. **Every action, test, or orchestrator run surfaces new gaps, TODOs, or lessons learned.**
2. **All surfaced items are logged to the suggestion log and reflected in the [Finalization Dashboard](../../project_meta/insights/finalization_dashboard.md).**
3. **The dashboard is auto-updated by the updater script (`npm run update-dashboard`) on every commit, push, or CI run.**
4. **Contributors pick up actionable items directly from the dashboard, ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.**
5. **Every improvement or fix is documented and cross-linked, further improving the system.**
6. **If the automation itself fails or can be improved, that too is surfaced and addressed in the next cycle.**

### How to Participate
- Always check the dashboard before starting work.
- Log any new gaps, stubs, or improvement ideas in the suggestion log.
- Run `npm run update-dashboard` after making changes to keep the dashboard current.
- Pick up actionable items from the dashboard and mark them complete as you go.
- Document all lessons learned and improvements for the next contributor.

This process ensures the system is always improving, always auditable, and always ready for onboarding and handoff.

## Soulfra Snowball Automation: Onboarding & Usage

To ensure all contributors and operators follow the Soulfra Standard, use the snowball automation flow:

1. **Dry Run:**
   - Run `npm run snowball -- --dry-run` to preview all actions and surface any issues.
2. **Debug & Fix:**
   - Address any errors or gaps surfaced in the dry run.
   - Rerun dry run until clean.
3. **Live Run:**
   - Run `npm run snowball` to update logs, dashboard, and create a backup.
4. **Backup Validation:**
   - Confirm the backup file exists and is restorable.
   - Log backup results in the dashboard and suggestion log.
5. **Spiral-Out:**
   - Surface and address any new issues or TODOs.
   - Repeat as needed for continuous improvement.
