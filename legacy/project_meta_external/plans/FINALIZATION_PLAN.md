# Clarity Engine Docs - Finalization Plan

## 1. Project Goals

The primary goal of this finalization phase is to transform the current collection of scripts and documents into a **robust, reliable, and maintainable Unified Migration and Document Processing System**. This system should:

*   Safely consolidate and process existing project documentation.
*   Eliminate redundancy through intelligent deduplication.
*   Enforce consistent metadata and structure via tagging and standardization.
*   Provide comprehensive dependency analysis to prevent accidental data loss or broken links.
*   Establish a solid foundation for future enhancements, including RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), database integration, and advanced AI-powered document understanding.
*   Ensure all operations are transparent, auditable, and require user confirmation for critical actions.

## 2. Core Modules & Responsibilities

The system will revolve around the `scripts/unified-migration/` directory and its core components:

*   **`safety-validator.js`**: Initial checks for permissions, backup system, file conflicts, path validity, recursion, and integrity.
*   **`analyze-dependencies.js` (Enhanced)**: Deep analysis of file inter-dependencies (imports, links, references) to map upstream and downstream impacts of any changes.
*   **`process-duplicates.js` (Enhanced)**: Interactive tool for handling files flagged as duplicates by `safety-validator.js`. Will use similarity checks and dependency information to guide user decisions (delete, merge, tag).
*   **`scripts/unified-migration/core/content-standardizer.js` (Created)**: Module for ensuring consistent Markdown formatting and YAML frontmatter across all documents.
*   **`scripts/core/llm-bulkhead.js` (Created)**: A structured interface for future AI/LLM calls (summarization, auto-tagging, Q&A), ensuring isolated, reliable, and logged interactions.
*   **`scripts/unified-migration/core/document-indexer.js` (Created)**: Creates a searchable index of all processed documents, including their metadata and key content attributes.
*   **`core/orchestrator.js` (`UnifiedMigrationOrchestrator`)**: Manages the overall workflow, coordinating the execution of tasks from other modules.
*   **`core/dependency-manager.js`**: Manages dependency analysis results for the orchestrator.
*   **`core/task-manager.js`**: Builds and validates the migration task queue based on dependencies.
*   **`core/document-processor.js`**: Handles the actual processing/transformation of individual files/documents (now integrates `ContentStandardizer`).
*   **`core/report-generator.js`**: Generates comprehensive reports for all operations.
*   **`run-safe-migration.js`**: The main user-facing script that orchestrates the entire safe migration process, including validation, backups, interactive steps, dry-runs, and final execution.
*   **`backup.js` & `rollback.js`**: Essential safety nets for data integrity.
*   **Helper Modules (e.g., `scripts/unified-migration/helpers/file-operations-helper.js`)**: Focused utility modules created as needed to support core modules and maintain modularity.

## 3. Key Features for Finalization

### 3.1. Enhanced Dependency Analysis
*   **Goal**: Provide a clear map of how files are interconnected.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   Modify `analyze-dependencies.js` to output a detailed JSON report (`dependency-report.json`) listing for each file:
        *   `filePath`: The path to the file.
        *   `dependencies`: Array of files this file directly depends on (e.g., imports, `require`).
        *   `dependents`: Array of files that directly depend on this file (e.g., files that import it).
        *   `linksTo`: Array of files this file links to (e.g., Markdown links).
        *   `linkedBy`: Array of files that link to this file.
    *   Ensure this report is easy to parse and use by other tools.

### 3.2. Interactive Batch Deduplication & Tagging
*   **Goal**: Safely resolve duplicate content and apply consistent metadata.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   Create/Enhance `scripts/unified-migration/process-duplicates.js`.
    *   This script will:
        *   Read `safety-validation-report.json` (for initial duplicate list) and `dependency-report.json`.
        *   For each set of duplicate filenames:
            *   Calculate content similarity score (e.g., using `string-similarity`).
            *   Display paths, similarity score, and dependency information (dependents/dependencies/links) for each file in the set.
            *   Prompt user with choices: `(d)elete selected`, `(m)erge (manual placeholder)`, `(t)ag and keep all`, `(k)eep one, delete others`, `(s)kip`.
            *   If deleting a file with dependents/linkedBy, issue a strong warning and require double confirmation.
            *   If tagging, prompt for standard YAML frontmatter tags (e.g., `system`, `component`, `type`, `status`, `keywords`).
            *   Perform actions in batches, with confirmation for each batch.
            *   Log all decisions and actions.

### 3.3. Content Standardization
*   **Goal**: Ensure all Markdown documents adhere to a consistent format and metadata schema.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   Create `scripts/unified-migration/core/content-standardizer.js`.
    *   Implement functions to:
        *   Parse and validate/update YAML frontmatter (ensure required fields like `title`, `id`, `version`, `lastUpdated`, `tags` are present).
        *   Auto-generate missing unique IDs if necessary.
        *   (Optional) Basic Markdown linting/formatting.
    *   Integrate this into `DocumentProcessor.js` to run on relevant files.

### 3.4. LLM Bulkhead (Structural Setup)
*   **Goal**: Create a safe and maintainable interface for future LLM interactions.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   Create `scripts/core/llm-bulkhead.js`.
    *   Define `LLMCallManager` class with methods for:
        *   `constructor(apiKey, options)`
        *   `async callLLM(prompt, promptTemplateName, outputSchema)` (initially can be a mock).
        *   Handling retries, basic logging (input/output/latency).
    *   This module won't be fully utilized in this phase but sets the stage.

### 3.5. Document Indexing
*   **Goal**: Create a structured, searchable index of all processed documents.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   Create `scripts/unified-migration/core/document-indexer.js`.
    *   Implement `DocumentIndexer` class with methods to:
        *   `constructor(indexPath)`
        *   `async indexFile(filePath, metadata, contentSummary)`
        *   `async buildIndex(fileList)`: Iterates through processed files, extracts metadata (from YAML) and a content summary (e.g., first N lines or an LLM-generated summary later), and saves to `document-index.json`.
    *   Integrate into `run-safe-migration.js` to run after successful migration.

### 3.6. Robust Safe Migration Runner
*   **Goal**: A single, reliable script to execute the entire finalized workflow.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   Update `run-safe-migration.js` to orchestrate the following sequence:
        1.  Run `safety-validator.js`. Handle errors/warnings.
        2.  Run enhanced `analyze-dependencies.js` to generate `dependency-report.json`.
        3.  (Optional, user-prompted) Run interactive `process-duplicates.js` using the safety and dependency reports.
        4.  Create a full backup.
        5.  Perform migration dry-run using `UnifiedMigrationOrchestrator` (which now uses `ContentStandardizer`).
        6.  User confirmation.
        7.  Execute live migration.
        8.  Post-migration verification (run `safety-validator.js` again).
        9.  Run `document-indexer.js` to build/update `document-index.json`.
        10. Generate final comprehensive report.
        11. Offer rollback if post-migration verification fails.

## 4. Safety Protocols

*   **Dry-Run First**: All potentially destructive operations (file modification, deletion) MUST have a dry-run mode that simulates actions and reports intended changes without making them.
*   **Explicit User Confirmation**: Critical steps (live migration, deletion of files with dependents) require explicit "yes" from the user.
*   **Automated Backups**: `run-safe-migration.js` will always create a timestamped full backup before any live operations.
*   **Rollback Mechanism**: The existing `rollback.js` will be maintained and tested.
*   **Batch Processing**: Interactive tasks like deduplication will operate in manageable batches.
*   **Comprehensive Logging**: All scripts will log their actions, decisions, errors, and warnings to console and potentially a central log file.

## 5. Success Metrics

The finalization phase will be considered successful when:

*   The `run-safe-migration.js` script can be executed end-to-end on the project.
*   All identified critical duplicate files are processed (deleted, merged, or tagged).
*   All target documents have consistent YAML frontmatter.
*   A comprehensive `dependency-report.json` is generated and utilized.
*   A `document-index.json` is successfully created.
*   No unintended file deletions or data loss occurs during a full test run.
*   The system structure is modular, with clear responsibilities for each script/module (most under 250 lines).

## 6. Step-by-Step Checklist

## 7. Log and Debug Orchestration

### 7.1. Log Orchestrator
- **Goal:** Centralize log directory creation, log writing, and event aggregation for all components.
- **Tasks:**
  - Create `scripts/core/log-orchestrator.js`.
  - Ensure all log directories exist (auto-create as needed).
  - Provide a unified API for all components to log events (debug, error, metrics, audit, etc.).
  - Aggregate logs for dashboards or summaries.
  - Support log rotation, retention, and archiving.
  - Emit events for log entries (so Debug Orchestrator can subscribe).

### 7.2. Debug Orchestrator
- **Goal:** Monitor for errors, exceptions, and warnings across the system, and coordinate automated debugging actions.
- **Tasks:**
  - Create `scripts/core/debug-orchestrator.js`.
  - Subscribe to Log Orchestrator events (especially errors).
  - Hook into global error handlers (`uncaughtException`, `unhandledRejection`).
  - Collect error events and run post-mortem analysis.
  - Generate debug summaries at the end of a run.
  - Optionally, trigger alerts or auto-create GitHub issues.

### 7.3. Integration
- **Goal:** Ensure both orchestrators are modular, autonomous, and ready for unit tests and styling.
- **Tasks:**
  - Update components to use Log Orchestrator for logging.
  - Wire Debug Orchestrator to Log Orchestrator.
  - Add end-of-run debug summary to main scripts.
