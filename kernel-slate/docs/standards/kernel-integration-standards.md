# Kernel Integration Standards

## Core Requirements

### 1. Documentation
- All modules must have YAML frontmatter
- Required sections: Overview, Implementation, Maintenance
- Must include at least one code block
- Must document dependencies and integration points
- Must reference kernel standards and onboarding docs

### 2. Testing
- E2E tests must be included
- Unit tests must be included
- Tests must pass in isolation
- Tests must pass when integrated with kernel
- Test coverage must be documented

### 3. Self-Healing
- All file operations must use `ensureFileAndDir`
- All logging must use the canonical LogOrchestrator
- No direct console.log usage
- Must implement error recovery
- Must validate file integrity

### 4. Backup Integration
- Must be included in backup scope
- Must have manifest entries
- Must validate on restore
- Must maintain file hashes
- Must document backup requirements

### 5. Standards Compliance
- Must follow line count limits
- Must use proper frontmatter
- Must use canonical logging
- Must follow naming conventions
- Must document compliance

## Integration Process

1. **Preparation**
   - Create documentation
   - Write tests
   - Implement self-healing
   - Prepare backup integration

2. **Validation**
   - Run documentation validator
   - Run E2E tests
   - Verify self-healing
   - Check backup integration

3. **Integration**
   - Create backup
   - Integrate module
   - Run full test suite
   - Verify backup health

4. **Documentation**
   - Update standards
   - Update checklists
   - Document process
   - Update onboarding

## Maintenance

- Regular health checks
- Backup verification
- Standards compliance
- Documentation updates
- Test maintenance
