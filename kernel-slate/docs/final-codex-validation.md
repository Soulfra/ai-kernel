# Final Codex Validation

## Runtime Check
- `node scripts/core/ensure-runtime.js` executed with warning `requirements.txt not found`.

## Make Commands
- `make verify`, `make prune`, and `make status` all fail with `missing separator` errors in the Makefile.

## Tests
- `npm test` ran 22 tests: **19 passed**, **3 skipped**, **0 failed**.

## Kernel Inspector
- `node scripts/dev/kernel-inspector.js` did not exit within 10 seconds and was manually terminated.

## CLI Commands
- `kernel-cli.js verify` fails due to the Makefile issue.
- `kernel-cli.js test` succeeds and runs the same test suite as `npm test`.
- `kernel-cli.js inspect` and `run release-check` hang and do not exit.
- No commands named `status`, `prune`, or `menu` are present.

## Configuration Files
- `installed-agents.json`, `kernel.json`, and `kernel-slate/docs/available-agents.json` all exist and contain valid JSON.

## Documentation
- `/docs` does **not** contain `kernel-status.md`, `kernel-audit.md`, or a README file. Those files do exist under `kernel-slate/docs`.

## Logs
- Logs are written to the `logs/` directory including `cli-output.json` and `kernel-inspector.log`.
