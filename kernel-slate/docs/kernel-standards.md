# Kernel Standards

This document defines required practices for CLARITY_ENGINE.

## Required CLI Commands

The main CLI (`kernel-slate/scripts/cli/kernel-cli.js`) must provide at least the following commands:

- `verify`
- `doctor`
- `release-check`
- `prune`
- `status`
- `inspect`

## Agent Rules

- Each agent must be defined in an `agent.yaml` file.
- Every agent requires a matching documentation file in `kernel-slate/docs/`.
- Agents listed in `agent.yaml` must also appear in `kernel-slate/docs/available-agents.json`.

## Documentation Rules

- Command and script docs are generated by `kernel-slate/scripts/agents/kernel-doc-sync.js`.
- `kernel-slate/docs/README.md` must contain only links verified by the doc sync report.
- No dead links are allowed in documentation.

## Pull Request Rules

- All PRs must pass `make verify`.
- Documentation files may not be edited manually unless explicitly allowed.

## Codex Logs

Codex agents must reference `logs/doc-sync-report.json` and `logs/semantic-cluster.json` when reasoning about docs or script structure. Never rely on assumptions.
