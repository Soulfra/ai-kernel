# CLARITY_ENGINE

A semantic clustering and relationship management system that combines modern AI practices with cybernetic principles.

## Overview

CLARITY_ENGINE is a powerful system for managing semantic relationships and clustering concepts. It provides:

- Semantic clustering of concepts
- Relationship management between concepts
- Vector-based similarity search
- Graph-based relationship storage
- AI-powered embedding generation
- Comprehensive validation and logging

## Architecture

The system consists of several core components:

### 1. Semantic Engine

The central component that orchestrates all operations:

- Concept management
- Relationship management
- Cluster management
- Health monitoring

### 2. Vector Store

Manages vector embeddings using Pinecone:

- Vector storage and retrieval
- Similarity search
- Efficient indexing

### 3. Graph Store

Manages relationships using Neo4j:

- Relationship storage
- Graph traversal
- Relationship queries

### 4. Embedding Service

Generates embeddings using OpenAI:

- Text embedding generation
- Batch processing
- Model management

### 5. Clustering Service

Performs clustering using HDBSCAN:

- Cluster creation
- Cluster merging
- Cluster management

### 6. Relationship Manager

Manages relationships between concepts:

- Relationship updates
- Relationship validation
- Relationship queries

### 7. Validation Service

Ensures data integrity:

- Concept validation
- Relationship validation
- Cluster validation

### 8. Logger

Provides comprehensive logging:

- Console logging
- File logging
- Error tracking

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/clarity-engine.git
   cd clarity-engine
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

## Configuration

The system requires several configuration files:

### 1. Environment Variables

```env
# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key

# Pinecone
PINECONE_API_KEY=your-api-key
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=your-environment

# Neo4j
NEO4J_URI=your-uri
NEO4J_USERNAME=your-username
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your-password
NEO4J_DATABASE=your-database

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

### 2. Semantic Engine Configuration

```yaml
semantic:
  engine:
    vector_store:
      type: "pinecone"
      dimensions: 1536
      index: "concepts"
    
    graph_store:
      type: "neo4j"
      uri: "bolt://localhost:7687"
      database: "semantic"
    
    embedding:
      provider: "openai"
      model: "text-embedding-ada-002"
      dimensions: 1536
    
    clustering:
      algorithm: "hdbscan"
      min_cluster_size: 5
      min_samples: 3
```

## Usage

### 1. Adding a Concept

```javascript
const { SemanticEngine } = require('./scripts/core/semantic-engine');

const engine = new SemanticEngine(config);

await engine.addConcept({
  id: 'concept-1',
  type: 'document',
  content: 'Example content',
  metadata: {
    author: 'John Doe',
    created: new Date()
  }
});
```

### 2. Finding Related Concepts

```javascript
const related = await engine.findRelated({
  id: 'concept-1',
  type: 'document',
  content: 'Example content'
});
```

### 3. Managing Relationships

```javascript
await engine.addRelationship({
  id: 'rel-1',
  type: 'references',
  source: 'concept-1',
  target: 'concept-2',
  strength: 0.8,
  confidence: 0.9
});
```

### 4. Clustering Concepts

```javascript
const cluster = await engine.createCluster([
  concept1,
  concept2,
  concept3
]);
```

## Development

### 1. Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### 2. Linting

```bash
npm run lint
```

### 3. Formatting

```bash
npm run format
```

## What is this?

This directory contains the **clean, minimal, E2E-tested backup+buildup kernel** for CLARITY_ENGINE. It is the foundation for all future development, onboarding, and scaling.

## Why a Kernel Slate?
- Avoids bloat and legacy entropy
- Ensures only E2E-tested, self-healing, and documented code is included
- Makes onboarding, handoff, and scaling 10x easier
- Provides a single source of truth for the system's core logic

## What's Included?
- Minimal backup+buildup orchestrator (self-healing, modular)
- `ensureFileAndDir` utility for robust file/dir creation
- E2E test for backup+buildup
- Canonical standards and checklists
- This README and a Kernel Reset doc

## How to Add New Features/Modules
1. **Write or port the feature in isolation.**
2. **Add/expand E2E tests to cover the new feature.**
3. **Use `ensureFileAndDir` for all file writes.**
4. **Update documentation and checklists.**
5. **Only merge if all E2E tests pass green.**

## How to Run the E2E Test
```
npx jest tests/core/backup-buildup.e2e.test.js
```

## How to Run a Real Backup or Restore
To create a real backup in your workspace:
```
node scripts/core/backup-orchestrator.js --backup
```
To restore from a backup:
```
node scripts/core/backup-orchestrator.js --restore <backupPath>
```

## How to Check Backup Health
To verify all backups:
```
node scripts/core/backup-health-check.js
```

> The E2E test uses a temp directory and does not create persistent backups. Use the above commands for real, operator-facing backups.

## Backup Dashboard
To see all backups, their health, and status:
```
node scripts/core/backup-dashboard.js
```

## Webhook Notification
To post backup/restore events to a webhook:
```
export BACKUP_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-endpoint
node scripts/core/backup-orchestrator.js --backup
```
Or pass --webhook:
```
node scripts/core/backup-orchestrator.js --backup --webhook https://your-endpoint
```

## Automated Backup with Retention
To run a backup and prune old backups (default: keep last 5):
```
node scripts/core/automated-backup.js
```
Set retention with:
```
export BACKUP_RETENTION=10
```

## Compliance Report
To generate a Markdown compliance report:
```
node scripts/core/backup-compliance-report.js
```
See `reports/backup-compliance-report.md`.

## Suggestion Log Integration
On backup/restore failure, an entry is added to `project_meta/suggestion_log.md` with details and next steps.
