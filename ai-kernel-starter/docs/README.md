# AI Kernel Starter

This starter repo provides the minimal runtime of the ai-kernel system. It lets you pair a vault, speak to Cal Riven and create ideas without any legacy baggage.

## Key Commands
- `make launch` – clone and start the server
- `make serve` – run the local web UI on port 3000
- `make voice` – record a short voice reflection
- `make unlock` – unlock export access for `$1` or via referral
- `make devkit` – export your vault as a DevKit bundle

See `INSTALL.md` for setup details.
