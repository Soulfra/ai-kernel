# Documentation Automation

Automating documentation keeps the knowledge base fresh and reduces manual effort. Consider the following approaches:

1. **Code Parsing** – Use a script to scan source files for comments and generate API references.
2. **Chat Log Extraction** – Process chat logs to produce summaries and action items for documentation.
3. **Continuous Integration** – Run documentation generation as part of the CI pipeline and fail builds when docs are outdated.

These practices align with the goals outlined in [ESSENTIAL_DOCS](../ESSENTIAL_DOCS.md).
