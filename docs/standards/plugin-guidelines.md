# Plugin Development Guidelines

These guidelines extend the [Orchestration Standards](./orchestration-standards.md) with concrete steps for building plugins.

## Directory Structure

```text
plugin/
├── manifest.yaml
├── src/
│   └── index.js
├── tests/
│   ├── unit/
│   └── e2e/
└── docs/
    └── README.md
```

## Requirements

- Follow the kernel's logging and self-healing standards.
- Provide unit and E2E tests.
- Document public APIs in `docs/README.md`.
- Register the plugin via `manifest.yaml`.

## Integration Steps

1. Place the plugin under `plugins/`.
2. Add the plugin to the kernel configuration.
3. Run the full test suite to validate integration.
