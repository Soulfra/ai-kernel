# DevKit Export

Run `make devkit user=<id>` to bundle the current vault as a zip file. If your vault has fewer than one token you will see:

```
This vault is sealed. You can unlock it for $1 or with a referral.
```

Unlock by depositing a token with `make unlock user=<id>` or by sharing a referral code via `make refer`.
