# Frontend Sandbox

The `frontend/` folder contains a simple web sandbox. Open `index.html` in a browser to view it.

## Features

- Drag and drop `.chatlog.zip`, `.idea.yaml`, `.snapshot.json` and other files
- Markdown is rendered to HTML
- YAML and JSON files are displayed in a formatted viewer
- Shows the current token balance from `vault/<user>/tokens.json`

This interface is purely client side and works against files in the repository.
