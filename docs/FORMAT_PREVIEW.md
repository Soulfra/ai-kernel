# Format Preview

The sandbox viewer can render several file types:

- `.idea.yaml` – displayed as raw YAML
- `.json` – formatted JSON
- `.md` – markdown rendered to HTML
- `.agent.zip` – shows an install option (no upload performed)

Drop files onto the interface or select them via the file input to preview.
